on the add assets page i tested different sizes of multiple assets being added at once 

10,000 assets at once takes - 
1 Minute 50 Seconds (110s)

5,000 assets at once takes - 
50 seconds

2,500 assets at once takes - 
26seconds

1,000 assets at once takes - 
10 seconds

500 assets at once takes - 
5seconds

100 assets at once takes -
~1 second


even with 60,0000 assets in the table the website still performs well, even loads the view_assets page within 1 second and sorting / searching is responsive
at  around 100,000 assets the view assets page becomes very slow
