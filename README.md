Bachelors Software Engineering Final Year Project 

My Project - 

  an asset tracking and borrowing system 

  users can borrow devices on the system if they are marked as borrowable, they can borrow for a set number of days before returning 

  Admins can add and edit assets to the system, they can also manage user account including disabling accounts 

  borrowed assets can be tracked to view how many days they have been borrowed for and can be force returned to the system
